♟️ Real-Time Multiplayer Chess Platform

A modern, real-time multiplayer chess platform built from the ground up with WebSockets and WebRTC. This project goes beyond standard chess applications by integrating live communication features, complex game logic, and real-time synchronization—creating an immersive and interactive chess experience.

🚀 Why This Project Stands Out                                                                           
Unlike simple chess clones, this platform required implementing complex game state management, concurrency handling, and custom communication pipelines. Key challenges included ensuring consistency of moves across clients, integrating chat and video communication, and handling chess-specific edge cases like draws, stalemates, pawn promotions, and checkmate detection.

🔑 Features
🔗 Real-Time Multiplayer Chess

Play live chess games with friends or random opponents.
Built on WebSockets for instant, lag-free synchronization of moves.
Ensures both players always share the same consistent game state.

🏠 Room System

Create private rooms and share a unique Room ID.
Join existing rooms instantly with a valid Room ID.
Supports multiple isolated matches running in parallel.

💬 Live Chat

Integrated WebSocket-based chat for instant messaging.
No third-party apps needed—communicate with your opponent directly inside the game.

🎥 Video Call Integration

WebRTC-powered video calls embedded in the platform.
